Once we created a fairly simple keylogger, the example output it gave us was as follows

As shown in the image, using the code we create a file which will be created in the same folder 
where our main file is located. This file shows all the keystrokes made in the web browser, clearly 
showing which keys have been pressed so far. The only key that is identified by a space when pressed 
is the space bar, for greater clarity when reading the txt file.
